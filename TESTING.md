#Â Test Results

The Manual Testing document can be found here : [ Manual Test Results](/assets/testing/manual-testing.numbers).

## Test Strategy

The test strategy consisted of a combination of manual and automated tests.

- Parts of the appliction rely on CRUD operations to an external DB, and manual test cases were created to ensure isolate those tests that require internet access (Otherwise, a test could fail due to internet connectivity or some server error at the DB site although its application logic was correct). Partially it was started to mock the DB using `django-pytest` and `pytest_factoryboy` , but in the interest of time it was chosen to follow a manual test strategy here.
- The main parts of automated testing focussed on python unit testing with the pytest framework. Most of the functions were isolated from Django in separate files, in order to ensure atomic unit testing of pure application logic following a principle of **design for testability**. The Django functions then simply import the tested functions using pythons `import` statement.
- The modules for JS were tested only manually and via syntax validators

## Manual Tests

### Tests of Accessibility

#### Results A11y Color Test

#### Results WebAIM Accesibility Test

While the home page could be checkecd via URL in the automatic color contrast checker, that was not possible for the authenticated pages. For the pages that required authentication, only the color contrast check was done manually for each background-to-text color pair on the page. All Tests passed.

#### Results Google Lighthouse

All pages were tested with Google lighthouse using the `chrome-debug` browser as described in this document, using Option 4 of the Lighthouse documentation for testing authenticated pages [Running Lighthouse on Authenticated Pages](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/authenticated-pages.md), after globablly installing `lighthouse` with `node`. All Tests passed.

### Tests for Compatibility

### Results W3C HTML Validation

All Pages were tested with the offical W2C HTML validator [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) using the option 'Validate by Direct Input', copying the rendered html code from the browser with `Right Click > View Page Source`.

All tests passed.

### Results W3C CSS Validation

The entire CSS for this project was created by Tailwind's CSS build process. This process can be assumed to function correctly and is therefore not included in the tests.

Since there were no custom CSS files in this project, the test passes.

I tried the options listed on their GihThub issue page (https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/crispy-tailwind/issues/110) but none of these fixed the error. There is the option of manually adding aria labels via javascript - but I find it not ideal in terms of code readibility to mess with an imported package, and leave the error for now.   </li>
